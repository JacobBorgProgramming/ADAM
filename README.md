# ADAM
*Algorithmic Discourse And Memeing*

## What is A.D.A.M.?

ADAM is an algorithm based meme generator that makes memes based off of an index of current event, trends, and culture.

### Is ADAM some AI monster that is going to come for my job?

ADAM is not an AI, but an algorithm, meaning it requires manual training by a programmer.

### Is there bias?

Of course there is.

Any algorithm or artificial intelligence will be biased. It is impossible to keep one's own bias out of a program like this. If any developer tells you otherwise, they are being dishonest or are naive.
